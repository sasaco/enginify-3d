/**
 * Append a series of points to the given geometry that represent a Bezier curve.
 * The BÃ©zier curve starts at the last point in the given geometry, and ends at the last control point.
 * The other control points are intermediate control points to transition the curve from start to end points.
 * The first control point may be null to ensure a smooth transition occurs. In this case,
 * the second to last point of the given geometry is mirrored into the control points of the Bezier curve.
 * In other words, the trailing gradient of the geometry matches the new gradient of the curve.
 * @param {Object} options - options for construction
 * @param {Array} options.controlPoints - list of control points (2D) for the bezier curve
 * @param {Number} [options.segment=16] - number of segments per 360 rotation
 * @param {path2} geometry - the path of which to appended points
 * @returns {path2} a new path with the appended points
 * @alias module:modeling/geometries/path2.appendBezier
 *
 * @example
 * let p5 = path2.create({}, [[10,-20]])
 * p5 = path2.appendBezier({controlPoints: [[10,-10],[25,-10],[25,-20]]}, p5);
 * p5 = path2.appendBezier({controlPoints: [null, [25,-30],[40,-30],[40,-20]]}, p5)
